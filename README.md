# Portfolio

## Overview
This repository contains my personal frontend development portfolio, showcasing selected projects that highlight my skills in building responsive, user-friendly, and visually appealing web applications.

## Description
My portfolio is designed to present my journey and expertise as a Frontend Web Developer. It features a collection of projects where I apply HTML, CSS, JavaScript, TypeScript, React, and TailwindCSS to create interactive applications and clean, modern interfaces.

The goal of this portfolio is to demonstrate:
My ability to design and implement intuitive user experiences.
My technical knowledge of modern frontend frameworks and tools.
My continuous learning through practical, hands-on projects.
You can explore my projects directly in the browser through live demos, as well as browse the source code to see my approach to problem-solving, component design, and responsive layouts.
